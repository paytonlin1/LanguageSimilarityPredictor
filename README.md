### DESCRIPTION:
This is a final project aiming to creat a prediction model for language similarity based on data from https://asjp.clld.org/languages
### METHODS USED:
1. RandomForest Classification
2. Linear Regression
3. Decision Tree Classification
4. Cosine Similarity
5. Binary Classification
### FURTHER INFORMATION:
For more information read my paper regarding the project here: [LanguageSimilarityPredictor Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OmXNEYSgDPlXV9Kb2zFCjerAyo9HiHNB2nKuSJecdMU/edit?usp=sharing)
### REQUIREMENTS:
To run the simulation, you need to be able to run Jupyter Notebook, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn on Python 3.9.0+
